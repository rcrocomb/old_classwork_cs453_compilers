This directory contains files for the scanner portion of the 
first assignment:

   Makefile
	a make file that will build an executable "parse" 
	implementing a scanner.
	
	This make file assumes that the scanner is in a file
	called scanner.l -- this is not essential from the
	project perspective, but if you change the make of your
	scanner file you should (obviously) edit the make file
	accordingly.

   main.c
	the driver routine that repeatedly calls the scanner
	and prints out the token returned.  It shows how the
	yylex() and printtoken() functions are called.

   print.c
	a file containing code to print out tokens.  

   parse
	a SPARC/Solaris executable (i.e., runs on lectura) of my scanner.
	You could use this to compare the behavior of your scanner
	with mine.  (I will check your code by diffing its output
	against the output produced by this executable.)
	
	Usage:  parse < infile

   tokens.h
	a header file containing definitions of the various tokens.
